# 🚀 Transformer Model - Learning Journey

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to my exploration of the **Transformer** model! This journey has been an incredible learning experience, and I owe a special thanks to **Umar Jamil**, whose video tutorials helped me understand the depths of this architecture. 🙌

## 🔍 Understanding the Transformer

The Transformer model is a deep learning architecture that relies on self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrence. It consists of an **Encoder-Decoder** structure, where the encoder processes input sequences and the decoder generates outputs based on learned representations.

## 🛠 Components Explained

### 1️⃣ **Input Embeddings**
- Converts tokenized words into dense vector representations of size `d_model`.

### 2️⃣ **Positional Encoding**
- Adds positional information to embeddings since Transformers lack recurrence.

### 3️⃣ **Encoder Block**
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Allows the model to attend to different words simultaneously.
- **Feed Forward Network**: Applies transformations to encoded representations.
- **Residual Connections**: Helps in stabilizing training and avoiding vanishing gradients.

### 4️⃣ **Decoder Block**
- **Masked Self-Attention**: Ensures predictions are made sequentially.
- **Cross-Attention**: Attends to encoder outputs while generating predictions.

### 5️⃣ **Projection Layer**
- Converts final decoder outputs into logits over the vocabulary.
